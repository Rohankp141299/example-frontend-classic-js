# example-frontend-classic-js

This is still work in progress!

An example frontend for Vega implemented as a classic Node.js web app without any fancy stuff.

The idea is to provide a simple codebase where only basic knowledge to classic Javascript and HTML is needed to customize and get a journal up and running in no time.

* Node 6.5
* Express server
* Templating with HTML-like Handlebars
* Plain Javascript and CSS for the browser without any bundling.

Advanced users would probably want something like React, Browserify/Webpack, Babel etc, but this example will keep it as simple as possible.
